# Prediction Market Whale Tracker - Claude Code Configuration

## Project Overview

A subscription-based service that identifies high-value signals in prediction markets by tracking whale trades, smart money, and new accounts making outsized bets in non-sports markets.

## Skills Integration

This project uses [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) for structured development workflows.

**Skills are located in:** `.superpowers/skills/`

### Required Workflows

Before implementing any feature:
1. **Brainstorming** - Refine requirements through questions
2. **Writing Plans** - Create detailed implementation plans
3. **TDD** - Write failing test → watch fail → implement → watch pass → refactor
4. **Code Review** - Review against plan before marking complete

### Key Skills to Use

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `@.superpowers/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md` | Before writing ANY implementation code |
| `@.superpowers/skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md` | When planning multi-step features |
| `@.superpowers/skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md` | When requirements are unclear |
| `@.superpowers/skills/systematic-debugging/SKILL.md` | When debugging issues |
| `@.superpowers/skills/subagent-driven-development/SKILL.md` | For parallel task execution |

## Core Business Logic

### Alert Types (6 total)
1. **WHALE_TRADE** - Trades >= $10,000
2. **UNUSUAL_SIZE** - Z-score > 3 std deviations
3. **MARKET_ANOMALY** - Unusual for specific market
4. **NEW_WALLET** - First-time traders with $1k+ bets
5. **FOCUSED_WALLET** - Wallets in <=3 markets with 5+ trades
6. **SMART_MONEY** - Wallets with >60% win rate

### Key Constraint: No Sports Markets
Sports markets (NFL, NBA, etc.) are filtered OUT. Focus is on political/crypto/events where insider information is more likely.

## Testing Requirements

**All tests must follow TDD (Red-Green-Refactor):**

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_whale_detector.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```

**Test file naming:** `tests/test_<module_name>.py`

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run backend
uvicorn src.main:app --reload

# Run dashboard
cd dashboard && npm run dev

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Implementation Plans Location

Save all implementation plans to: `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`

Current planned features:
- [ ] Stripe billing integration
- [x] Kalshi market integration (partial - see Kalshi section below)
- [ ] Kalshi authenticated API (for trade data)
- [ ] Automated trading module
- [ ] Mobile app (React Native)

## Code Quality Standards

- **TDD:** Write failing test first, ALWAYS
- **DRY:** Don't repeat yourself
- **YAGNI:** Don't add features until needed
- **Type hints:** Use Python type hints
- **Docstrings:** Document public functions
- **Frequent commits:** Small, focused commits

## API Keys Required

See `.env.example` for all required/optional API keys:
- Polymarket (public, no key needed)
- Resend (email alerts)
- Discord/Telegram/Slack webhooks
- Stripe (billing - planned)
- Kalshi (planned)

---

## Railway Deployment

The service is deployed on Railway with automatic deployments from GitHub.

### Project Details
- **Project Name**: shimmering-kindness
- **Service Name**: web
- **Public URL**: https://web-production-9d2d3.up.railway.app
- **Health Check**: https://web-production-9d2d3.up.railway.app/health

### Railway CLI Commands
```bash
# Check status
railway status

# View logs
railway logs -n 100

# Set environment variable
railway variables --set KEY=value

# Deploy current code
railway up --detach

# Redeploy last deployment
railway redeploy -y
```

### Environment Variables (Railway)
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string (auto-set by Railway) |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | Discord webhook for forum channel |
| `DISCORD_THREAD_ID` | Thread ID for posting alerts (see below) |
| `POLL_INTERVAL` | Trade polling interval in seconds (default: 30) |
| `WHALE_THRESHOLD_USDC` | Minimum USD for whale alerts (default: 10000) |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level (default: INFO) |

---

## Discord Forum Channel Configuration

The Discord webhook points to a **forum channel**, which requires special handling.

### Key Details
- **Webhook URL**: Stored in Railway as `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`
- **Thread ID**: `1461073799905542420` (the "Whale Alerts" thread)
- **Thread Name**: "Whale Alerts"

### How Forum Channels Work
Discord forum channels require either:
1. `thread_id` as a **URL query parameter** (to post to existing thread)
2. `thread_name` in JSON body (to create new thread per message)

**IMPORTANT**: `thread_id` must be passed as a query param, NOT in the JSON body:
```python
# Correct
url = f"{webhook_url}?thread_id={thread_id}"
client.post(url, json=payload)

# Wrong - will fail with error 220001
payload["thread_id"] = thread_id  # Does NOT work!
```

### Testing Discord Webhook
```bash
cd prediction-market-tracker
python test_discord.py
```

The test script auto-detects forum channels and retries with `thread_name` if needed.

## Session Log (2026-01-14)

### Issue: Discord Alerts Not Posting

**Problem**: Alerts showing "sent to 1/2 channels" - Discord was failing silently.

**Root Cause**:
1. Discord webhook pointed to a **forum channel**
2. Forum channels require `thread_id` or `thread_name`
3. Initial fix passed `thread_id` in JSON body - **wrong!**
4. Discord API requires `thread_id` as URL query parameter

**Solution**:
1. Updated `src/alerter.py` to pass thread_id as query param:
   ```python
   url = f"{self.webhook_url}?thread_id={self.thread_id}"
   ```
2. Created "Whale Alerts" thread in forum channel
3. Set `DISCORD_THREAD_ID=1461073799905542420` on Railway

### Files Changed
- `src/alerter.py` - Discord forum channel support with thread_id as query param
- `src/config.py` - Added `DISCORD_THREAD_ID` and `DISCORD_THREAD_NAME` config options
- `test_discord.py` - New script to test Discord webhook connectivity

### Commits
- `700704c` - Add Discord forum channel support
- `70e8367` - Fix Discord forum channel: thread_id as query param
- `1d2e2eb` - Improve alert quality and clarity

### Result
Alerts now posting successfully to Discord:
```
🎮 Discord alert sent
📢 Alert sent to 2/2 channels
```

---

### Issue: Alert Quality Improvements (Same Session)

**Problems reported:**
1. No platform identification (Polymarket vs Kalshi vs PredictIt)
2. Market question not always shown (just saw "Down" outcome with no context)
3. Severity meaning unclear (what does HIGH mean?)

**Solution:**
Updated `alerter.py` and `polymarket_client.py`:

1. **Added `platform` field** to Trade dataclass (defaults to "Polymarket")
2. **Market question always shown** - Falls back to market ID if unavailable
3. **Position instead of Outcome** - Shows "Buy No" or "Sold Yes" instead of just "No"
4. **Severity explanation** - HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW now include descriptions

**New Alert Format (v2 - with links and categories):**
```
📊 Market: Will Elon Musk post 440-459 tweets...? [clickable link]
🏛️ Category: Entertainment
🏦 Platform: Polymarket
💰 Amount: $1,150.66
🎯 Position: Buy No
⚡ Severity: HIGH (Large trade size, unusual pattern, or high-confidence signal)
👤 Trader: 0x1234... [clickable link to profile]
```

**New Features (commit d9790c7):**
- **Market URL** - Clickable link to Polymarket market page
- **Trader URL** - Clickable link to trader's Polymarket profile
- **Category** - Auto-detected (Politics, Crypto, Sports, Finance, Entertainment, Science, World, Other)
- **Category emojis**: 🏛️ Politics, ₿ Crypto, ⚽ Sports, 📈 Finance, 🎬 Entertainment, 🔬 Science, 🌍 World

**Category Detection:**
1. First checks API tags field
2. Falls back to keyword matching in question text:
   - Politics: trump, biden, election, congress, senate, etc.
   - Crypto: bitcoin, ethereum, btc, eth, blockchain, etc.
   - Sports: nfl, nba, super bowl, championship, etc.
   - Finance: stock, fed, inflation, gdp, etc.
   - Entertainment: oscar, grammy, twitter, elon, etc.

**Severity Meanings:**
- **HIGH** - Large trade size, unusual pattern, or high-confidence signal
- **MEDIUM** - Notable activity worth monitoring
- **LOW** - Minor signal, may be noise

**Position Action (commit 5ca64bc):**
Tracks whether a trade is opening, adding to, or closing a position:
- 🆕 **OPENING** - First trade in this market/outcome (new position)
- ➕ **ADDING** - Adding to an existing position in same direction
- 🔚 **CLOSING** - Reducing/exiting an existing position

**How it works:**
- Tracks per-market positions for each wallet (buy_shares, sell_shares, USD amounts)
- Before each trade, checks wallet's existing position in that market/outcome
- Long position (bought > sold) + SELL = CLOSING
- Long position + BUY = ADDING
- No position + any trade = OPENING
- Note: Position data resets on service restart (no persistence yet)

## Kalshi Integration (Added 2026-01-14)

### Overview
Kalshi is a CFTC-regulated US prediction market exchange. Integration added to track both Polymarket and Kalshi markets.

### Current Status: PARTIAL
- ✅ Market data (prices, volume, open interest)
- ❌ Trade data (requires authentication)

### Why Trade Data is Limited
The **Kalshi public elections API** (`api.elections.kalshi.com`) only provides market data. Trade-level data requires:
1. API key from Kalshi dashboard
2. RSA private key for request signing
3. Authentication on every request

Even WITH authentication, Kalshi trades do NOT expose trader identities (unlike Polymarket's blockchain transparency).

### Files Added/Changed
- `src/kalshi_client.py` - KalshiClient for public elections API
- `src/whale_detector.py` - Multi-platform TradeMonitor, anonymous trader detection
- `src/alerter.py` - Platform-specific URLs, anonymous trader handling
- `src/main.py` - Initialize both Polymarket + Kalshi clients
- `src/config.py` - Added `KALSHI_ENABLED` setting

### New API Endpoints
- `GET /platforms` - Shows enabled platforms and capabilities
- `GET /markets/kalshi` - Lists active Kalshi markets
- `GET /health` - Now shows active platforms list

### Environment Variables
| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `KALSHI_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable/disable Kalshi integration |

### Anonymous Trader Handling
Kalshi trades have `trader_address="KALSHI_ANON"`. The whale detector:
- **Skips** wallet-based alerts: NEW_WALLET, FOCUSED_WALLET, SMART_MONEY, REPEAT_ACTOR, HEAVY_ACTOR, WHALE_EXIT, CLUSTER_ACTIVITY, ENTITY_ACTIVITY
- **Still fires** trade-based alerts: WHALE_TRADE, UNUSUAL_SIZE, MARKET_ANOMALY, EXTREME_CONFIDENCE, HIGH_IMPACT

### To Enable Full Kalshi Trade Tracking
Would need to implement authenticated API access:
1. Sign up at https://kalshi.com
2. Go to Settings → API → Generate API Key
3. Download RSA private key
4. Set environment variables:
   - `KALSHI_API_KEY` - Your API key ID
   - `KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY` - Contents of private key (or path)
5. Implement RSA signing in `kalshi_client.py`

See: https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/api_keys

### Commit
- `790f661` - Add Kalshi prediction market integration
