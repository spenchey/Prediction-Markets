# Project Memory - Prediction Market Whale Tracker

> This file helps AI assistants understand the project context and continue work from previous sessions.
> **Last Updated:** January 12, 2026

## Project Overview

**Goal:** Build a subscription-based service that identifies high-value signals in prediction markets by tracking:
1. Large bets ("whale" trades) in real-time
2. New accounts making outsized bets (potential insider knowledge)
3. Accounts with high historical win rates ("smart money")
4. Accounts focused on specific markets (potential informed traders)

**Target Markets:** Non-sports prediction markets (politics, crypto, economics, events)
- Polymarket (primary)
- Kalshi (planned)
- Other platforms (future)

**Business Model:** Subscription service with:
- Free tier: Delayed alerts, basic access
- Pro tier ($29/month): Real-time alerts, smart money access, API
- Enterprise tier ($99/month): Unlimited, webhooks, priority support

## Project History

### Initial Development (ChatGPT + Sonnet)
Two separate implementations were created:
1. **Main Project (Sonnet):** Full-featured FastAPI app with React dashboard, multi-channel notifications
2. **MVP Project (ChatGPT):** Lightweight detector with focused wallet detection and granular severity

### Combined Implementation (Opus - January 2026)
Merged best features from both codebases:
- **From Sonnet:** Async architecture, comprehensive alerter, React dashboard, database persistence
- **From ChatGPT:** FOCUSED_WALLET detection, granular 1-10 severity scores, market anomaly detection
- **New additions:** Sports filtering, subscription management, email digests, smart money tracking

## Key Features

### Alert Types (6 total)
1. **WHALE_TRADE** - Trades >= $10,000 (configurable)
2. **UNUSUAL_SIZE** - Statistically abnormal (z-score based)
3. **MARKET_ANOMALY** - Unusual for specific market (from ChatGPT MVP)
4. **NEW_WALLET** - First-time traders with large bets
5. **FOCUSED_WALLET** - Wallets concentrated in few markets (from ChatGPT MVP)
6. **SMART_MONEY** - Wallets with >60% historical win rate

### Severity System
- **Categorical:** LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH (for display)
- **Granular:** 1-10 score (for filtering/sorting)

### Sports Filtering
Markets are classified as sports/non-sports using keyword detection. Sports markets are filtered OUT by default since the focus is on political/crypto/event markets where insider information is more likely.

### Notification Channels
- Console (always on)
- Email (via Resend.com)
- Discord (webhook)
- Telegram (bot)
- Slack (webhook)
- Push (Expo for mobile)
- Webhook (Enterprise only)

### Scheduled Reports
- Daily digest at 8 AM UTC
- Weekly report on Mondays at 9 AM UTC

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /` | Health check |
| `GET /markets` | List active markets |
| `GET /trades` | Recent trades |
| `GET /trades/whales` | Whale trades only |
| `GET /trades/wallet/{address}` | Trades by wallet |
| `GET /alerts` | Recent alerts |
| `GET /alerts/stream` | SSE real-time alerts |
| `GET /stats` | Overall statistics |
| `GET /stats/wallets` | Wallet leaderboard |
| `POST /scan` | Manual scan trigger |

## Configuration (.env)

Key settings to configure:
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./trades.db

# Detection thresholds
WHALE_THRESHOLD_USDC=10000
EXCLUDE_SPORTS_MARKETS=true

# Notifications (configure at least one)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxx
ALERT_EMAIL=your@email.com
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...

# Digests
DAILY_DIGEST_HOUR=8
WEEKLY_DIGEST_DAY=mon
```

## Current Status

### Completed
- [x] Core whale detection with 6 alert types
- [x] Sports market filtering
- [x] Multi-channel notifications
- [x] Database persistence
- [x] REST API with SSE streaming
- [x] React dashboard scaffolding
- [x] Subscription management module
- [x] Email digest scheduler
- [x] Configuration system

### In Progress / Needs Work
- [ ] Push to GitHub repository

## How to Continue Development

### Running Locally
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy env file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Run the backend
uvicorn src.main:app --reload

# Run the dashboard (separate terminal)
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Key Files to Understand
1. `src/whale_detector.py` - Core detection logic
2. `src/main.py` - API endpoints and app lifecycle
3. `src/config.py` - All configurable settings
4. `src/subscriptions.py` - Subscription tiers and limits

### Testing Detection
```bash
# Run the detector test
python -m src.whale_detector
```

## Notes for AI Assistants

When working on this project:
1. **Always filter sports markets** - This is a key differentiator
2. **Maintain both severity systems** - Categorical for display, numeric for filtering
3. **Test with real Polymarket data** - APIs are public, no auth needed
4. **Don't commit API keys** - Use .env file
5. **Keep subscriptions.py updated** - It defines business logic
